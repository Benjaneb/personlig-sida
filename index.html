        <div class="container">
          <h2>Quick introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Hello and welcome to my website that I've created! My name is
            Benjamin Widman and I am currently studying at a technology directed
            high school where I have a course about web development this school
            year, among many other interesting subjects. This website is the
            first assignment for the web development course so it isn't as high
            quality as my websites hopefully will be at the end of it.
          </p>
          <h2>Interests</h2>
          <p>
            My interests spread from most type of games and technology to anime
            and japanese culture. My favorite type of games are mostly rhythm
            games and visual novels, some examples are osu! and Persona 5 (more
            can be found on the <span><a href="games.html">games page</a></span
            >).
          </p>
          <h2>Future plans</h2>
          <div class="img-wrapper">
            <img src="images/kth_entrance.jpg" alt="Entrance of KTH" id="kth" />
            <p class="inline">
              In the future I'm aiming to possibly become a civil engineer of
              computer science or information technology student at KTH (The
              Royal Institute of Technology) if I manage to get good enough
              grades. I would also like to do some of my studies in Japan if
              that's possible, either way I would definitely visit the country
              some time in the future since I've been far too adored by the
              scenery and everything else that I've seen on platforms like
              YouTube.
