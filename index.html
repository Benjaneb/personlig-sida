          <h2>Quick introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Hello and welcome to my website that I've created! My name is
            Benjamin Widman and I am currently studying at a technology directed
            high school where I have a course about web development this school
            year, among many other interesting subjects. This website is the
            first assignment for the web development course so it isn't as high
            quality as my websites hopefully will be at the end of it.
          </p>
          <h2>Interests</h2>

            </div>
            <p>
              My interests spread from most type of games and technology to anime
              and japanese culture. My favorite type of games are mostly rhythm
              games and visual novels, some examples are osu! and Persona 5 (more
              can be found on the <span><a href="games.html">games page</a></span
              >).
            </p>
            <p>
              In terms of technology, I'm really interested in everything that has
              to do with computers. For example, I've built, upgraded and picked
              parts for my PC the last five years or so and I regularly watch tech
              related channels on YouTube, which is exactly what has mostly
              sparked my interest on the whole topic.
            </p>

          <h2>Future plans</h2>
          <img src="images/kth_entrance.jpg" alt="Entrance of KTH" id="kth" />
          <p>
            In the future I'm aiming to possibly become a civil engineer of
            computer science or information technology student at KTH (The Royal
            Institute of Technology) if I manage to get good enough grades. I
            would also like to do some of my studies in Japan if that's
            possible, either way I would definitely visit the country some time
            in the future since I've been far too adored by the scenery and
            everything else that I've seen on platforms like YouTube.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the moment I have no idea what I exactly want to work with when
            I'm done with my education, though that should be expected from a
            high school student. All I know is that I'm really enthusiastic
            about computers so it'll definitely be something related to that at
            very least.
