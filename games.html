            <h3>Explanation</h3>
            <p>
              Earier this year I got into the Persona-series by playing the
              fifth game of the franchise, Persona 5. After that I got
              completely hooked so later I also want to play it's prequel,
              Persona 4.
            </p>
            <p>
              I started playing Danganronpa roughly two years ago and since then
              I have played Danganronpa 1: Trigger Happy Havoc & Danganronpa 2:
              Goodbye Despair. Just like with the Persona-series now, I got
              hooked on the franchise back then and that's why I plan to play
              the prequels, Danganronpa AE (Another Episode): Ultra Despair
              Girls & Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony.
